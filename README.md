Transformer Failure Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts the failure condition of power transformers. It provides a simple Tkinter-based user interface for users to input transformer parameters and check the failure status.

Features

Predictive Model: Uses a trained logistic regression model for predictions.
Input Variables:
Oil Temperature (°C)
Winding Temperature (°C)
Voltage Input/Output (V)
Current Input/Output (A)
Vibration (g)
Humidity (%)
Pressure (bar)
Transformer Age (years)
Easy-to-Use GUI: A desktop-based interface built with Tkinter.
Failure Detection: Outputs whether the transformer is likely to fail or operate normally

How to Use

Run the app.py file.
Enter the transformer parameters in the input fields.
Click the "Predict" button to check the failure condition.
The result will display as either "Failure" or "No Failure".
